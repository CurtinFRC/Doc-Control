**Make sure you have the [wombat CLI](wombat-cli) installed before continuing.**

## Create a project

To create a project run the following command in a terminal (**make sure you are in the directory you want to create the project in**):

```bash
wombat create <project-name>
```

This will create a new directory with the name `<project-name>` and create a wombat project inside of it.
